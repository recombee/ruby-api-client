  #Deletes an item of the given `itemId` from the catalog.
  #
  #If there are any *purchases*, *ratings*, *bookmarks*, *cart additions*, or *detail views* of the item present in the database, they will be deleted in cascade as well. Also, if the item is present in some *series*, it will be removed from all the *series* where present.
  #
  #If an item becomes obsolete/no longer available, it is meaningful to keep it in the catalog (along with all the interaction data, which are very useful), and **only exclude the item from recommendations**. In such a case, use [ReQL filter](https://docs.recombee.com/reql.html) instead of deleting the item completely.
