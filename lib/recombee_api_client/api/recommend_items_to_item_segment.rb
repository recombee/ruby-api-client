  #Recommends Items that are the most relevant to a particular Segment from a context [Segmentation](https://docs.recombee.com/segmentations.html).
  #
  #Based on the used Segmentation, this endpoint can be used for example for:
  #
  #- Recommending articles related to a particular topic
  #- Recommending songs belonging to a particular genre
  #- Recommending products produced by a particular brand
  #
  #You need to set the used context Segmentation in the Admin UI in the [Scenario settings](https://docs.recombee.com/scenarios) prior to using this endpoint.
  #
  #The returned items are sorted by relevance (the first item being the most relevant).
  #
  #It is also possible to use the POST HTTP method (for example, in the case of a very long ReQL filter) â€” query parameters then become body parameters.

  # * *Required arguments*
  #   - +context_segment_id+ -> ID of the segment from `contextSegmentationId` for which the recommendations are to be generated.
  #   - +target_user_id+ -> ID of the user who will see the recommendations.
  #
  #Specifying the *targetUserId* is beneficial because:
  #
  #* It makes the recommendations personalized
  #* Allows the calculation of Actions and Conversions
  #  in the graphical user interface,
  #  as Recombee can pair the user who got recommendations
  #  and who afterward viewed/purchased an item.
  #
  #If you insist on not specifying the user, pass `null`
  #(`None`, `nil`, `NULL` etc., depending on the language) to *targetUserId*.
  #Do not create some special dummy user for getting recommendations,
  #as it could mislead the recommendation models,
  #and result in wrong recommendations.
  #
  #For anonymous/unregistered users, it is possible to use, for example, their session ID.
  #
  #   - +count+ -> Number of items to be recommended (N for the top-N recommendation).
  #
  # * *Optional arguments (given as hash optional)*
  #   - +scenario+ -> Scenario defines a particular application of recommendations. It can be, for example, "homepage", "cart", or "emailing".
  #
  #You can set various settings to the [scenario](https://docs.recombee.com/scenarios.html) in the [Admin UI](https://admin.recombee.com). You can also see the performance of each scenario in the Admin UI separately, so you can check how well each application performs.
  #
  #The AI that optimizes models to get the best results may optimize different scenarios separately or even use different models in each of the scenarios.
  #
  #   - +cascadeCreate+ -> If an item of the given *itemId* or user of the given *targetUserId* doesn't exist in the database, it creates the missing entity/entities and returns some (non-personalized) recommendations. This allows, for example, rotations in the following recommendations for the user of the given *targetUserId*, as the user will be already known to the system.
  #   - +returnProperties+ -> With `returnProperties=true`, property values of the recommended items are returned along with their IDs in a JSON dictionary. The acquired property values can be used to easily display the recommended items to the user.

  #
  #   - +filter+ -> Boolean-returning [ReQL](https://docs.recombee.com/reql.html) expression, which allows you to filter recommended items based on the values of their attributes.
  #
  #Filters can also be assigned to a [scenario](https://docs.recombee.com/scenarios.html) in the [Admin UI](https://admin.recombee.com).
  #
  #   - +booster+ -> Number-returning [ReQL](https://docs.recombee.com/reql.html) expression, which allows you to boost the recommendation rate of some items based on the values of their attributes.
  #
  #Boosters can also be assigned to a [scenario](https://docs.recombee.com/scenarios.html) in the [Admin UI](https://admin.recombee.com).
  #
  #   - +logic+ -> Logic specifies the particular behavior of the recommendation models. You can pick tailored logic for your domain and use case.
  #See [this section](https://docs.recombee.com/recommendation_logics.html) for a list of available logics and other details.
  #
  #The difference between `logic` and `scenario` is that `logic` specifies mainly behavior, while `scenario` specifies the place where recommendations are shown to the users.
  #
  #Logic can also be set to a [scenario](https://docs.recombee.com/scenarios.html) in the [Admin UI](https://admin.recombee.com).
  #
  #   - +minRelevance+ -> **Expert option** If the *targetUserId* is provided:  Specifies the threshold of how relevant must the recommended items be to the user. Possible values one of: "low", "medium", "high". The default value is "low", meaning that the system attempts to recommend a number of items equal to *count* at any cost. If there is not enough data (such as interactions or item properties), this may even lead to bestseller-based recommendations being appended to reach the full *count*. This behavior may be suppressed by using "medium" or "high" values. In such case, the system only recommends items of at least the requested relevance and may return less than *count* items when there is not enough data to fulfill it.
  #
  #   - +rotationRate+ -> **Expert option** If the *targetUserId* is provided: If your users browse the system in real-time, it may easily happen that you wish to offer them recommendations multiple times. Here comes the question: how much should the recommendations change? Should they remain the same, or should they rotate? Recombee API allows you to control this per request in a backward fashion. You may penalize an item for being recommended in the near past. For the specific user, `rotationRate=1` means maximal rotation, `rotationRate=0` means absolutely no rotation. You may also use, for example, `rotationRate=0.2` for only slight rotation of recommended items.
  #
  #   - +rotationTime+ -> **Expert option** If the *targetUserId* is provided: Taking *rotationRate* into account, specifies how long it takes for an item to recover from the penalization. For example, `rotationTime=7200.0` means that items recommended less than 2 hours ago are penalized.
  #
  #   - +expertSettings+ -> Dictionary of custom options.
  #
  #   - +returnAbGroup+ -> If there is a custom AB-testing running, return the name of the group to which the request belongs.
  #
